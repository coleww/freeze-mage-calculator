FREEZE-MAGE-CALCULATOR
---------------------------------------

A handy dandy UI for tracking yr potential burst damage in hearthstone. 
Because I got tired of counting my spell damage every turn. 
Built with react and redux.

## WIP/ TODO:
- handle playing torches
- calculate max damage by mana (this gonna be weird)
- probably use flexbox or CSS grids to handle final styling
- DRY up "area" components by extending a base component instead
- (maybe) calculate % of drawing a card

### FAQ:

- Q: is this cheating?
- A: nah

- Q: could you make this work for {other_deck_type}?
- A: nah

- Q: how dare you play a non-interactive deck like freeze mage!
- A: can't hear you, you and all of yr minions are frozen


### development

- npm install // download all them sweet sweet dependencies

- npm run start // fire up the dev server
- npm run test // will run any test files in `./src` that end in `.test.js`
- npm run build // bundles up a production version of the app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
