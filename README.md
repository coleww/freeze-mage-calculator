FREEZE-MAGE-CALCULATOR
---------------------------------------

A handy dandy UI for tracking yr potential burst damage in hearthstone. 
Because I got tired of counting my spell damage every turn. 
Built with react and redux.

## WIP/ TODO:
- add relevant card data, grab imgs?
- render out UI (all cards in deck)
- click to move cards to next "state"
- handle playing torches
- handle adding a thaurissan tick to yr hand
- calculate max damage by mana
- (maybe) calculate % of drawing a card

### FAQ:

- Q: is this cheating?
- A: nah

- Q: could you make this work for {other_deck_type}?
- A: nah

- Q: how dare you play a non-interactive deck like freeze mage!
- A: can't hear you, you and all of yr minions are frozen
